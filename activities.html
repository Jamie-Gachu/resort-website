    <li><h2>EXPLORE THE ZAINA CAYS</h2></li>
    <p>
      A haven for marine, plant, and wild life, Zaina Cays boasts one of the largest protected nature reserves in the Caribbean. The island’s 300,000 acres of wetlands,
      reefs, and marine replenishment zones, are preserved and protected by The Zaina Cays Conservancy and Trust. The Cays National Park is home to wild boar, rock iguana,
      tropical butterflies, over 25 species of orchid, and shelters the endangered Cays Flamingo. With more than 200 endemic and migrating species, Zaina Cays is one of the
      finest birding locations in the Bahamas, rich in pink ibis, spoonbills, herons, hawks, hummingbirds, swallows, woodstars, parrots, and piping plovers.
      The saltwater channels of Zaina Cay teem with sea turtles, starfish, and dolphins. One hundred miles deep, the world’s largest barrier reef lies one hundred feet
      offshore; colourful angelfish and parrotfish, stingrays and nurse sharks navigating pristine coral gardens. Dropping sharply into a trench known as the Gates of Hades,
      the sea floor plunges to depths of more than 6,000 feet and is home to marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, marlin, and other large fish species.
