      A hidden gem just off Androsâ€™ mainland,  Zaina Cay sparkles in all its blue-hued Bahamian beauty.
      Whispering the promise of laidback hospitality to captivated first-time visitors and longtime guests, this treasured 700-acre private island retreat charms with
      a singular blend of luxurious accommodations, deserted beaches and the kind of gracious warmth and hospitality that can only be achieved through a labour of love
      that spans decades.<br> If you breathe deeply, you can feel the caressing balm of the salt air. If you amble barefoot on our ancient sands, you can intimately
      connect to yourself and your beloved. This is the beauty of Zaina Cay Island. For thousands of years, the shores of our paradise were untouched, and the spirit
      of Zaina Cay Island danced only with the waves and the wind. Its coconut palms bowed gracefully to the majestic ocean, the coral reefs, and the frolicking sea life.  The generous sun kissed its mountains, the full moon rose to welcome mystery, and the stars twinkled against the night sky promising the wonders of the eternal and a brilliant future.<br>
      This is the magic of Zaina Cay. A place where the soul is touched, by both the people and the wild and primal freedom of nature
